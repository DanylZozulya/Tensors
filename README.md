# Tensors
#Implementation of tensors (numpy-like arrays) in C++.

#The following operations are implemented:

#Adding (tensor + number, tensor + tensor)

#Subtracting (tensor - number, tensor - tensor)

#Multiplication (tensor * tensor pointwise, tensor * number pointwise)

#Division

#Reshaping

#Copying

#Getting subtensor
